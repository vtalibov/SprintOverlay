# SSDB - Sprint Structure DataBase

A simple program to serve database with structures.

For each structure, a database entry is created. Each entry consists of:
* Project
* Target (protein)
* Crystallographic system
* Series ID
* Ligand ID
* Comment
* Path to the structure

## About the database

SSDB web interface allows some basic manipulations, but better to do it locally
with a dedicated tool. [DB Browser for
SQLite](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser) works well.

## To start locally

Install the required packages for your Python.
